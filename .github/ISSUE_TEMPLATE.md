## XxxPermissionsDispatcher does not generated?
 - Add `@RuntimePermissions` and `@NeedsPermission`?
 - Rebuild? (Sync is not rebuild)
 - Don't mix `apt` and `annotationProcessor`
 - Use `kpat` if your project is Kotlin
 - Avoid using Realm v1.x. see [#270](https://github.com/hotchemi/PermissionsDispatcher/issues/270)
 - Still have an issue...then attach Activity/Fragment and build.gradle.
